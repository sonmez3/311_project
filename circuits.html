            <p>The Turkish Grand Prix is a relatively new addition to the Formula One calendar, having first been held
                in 2005. The race is held at the Istanbul Park circuit, which is located on the Asian side of Istanbul
                and is known for its challenging layout and high-speed corners.

                The Istanbul Park circuit is a favorite among drivers, featuring several high-speed corners and
                elevation changes that test the limits of both drivers and their cars. The circuit's most famous corner
                is Turn 8, a long and fast left-hander that puts incredible strain on drivers' necks and tires.

                The Turkish Grand Prix has had several memorable moments over the years, including the infamous clash
                between Red Bull teammates Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber in 2010, and the dramatic battle between
                Lewis Hamilton and Felipe Massa in 2008.

                The race has also seen several different winners, including Felipe Massa, Kimi Raikkonen, and Jenson
                Button. However, the most successful driver at the Turkish Grand Prix is Sebastian Vettel, who won the
                race three times in a row between 2011 and 2013.

                Despite some challenges, such as low spectator attendance and financial issues, the Turkish Grand Prix
                remains an exciting addition to the Formula One calendar. Its challenging circuit, unpredictable weather
                conditions, and historic city location make it a unique and exciting event for both drivers and fans.

                navigate the treacherous corners and fast straights while adapting to changing conditions.

                The Eau Rouge corner, located at the bottom of a steep hill, is one of the most famous and challenging
                corners on the circuit. Drivers must navigate the corner at high speeds, while dealing with changes in
                elevation and the potential for unpredictable weather conditions.

                Over the years, many legendary drivers have won at Spa, including Michael Schumacher, Ayrton Senna, and
                Jim Clark. The circuit has also seen its share of controversy, including the tragic death of driver
